# Jenkins Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Jenkins Project! This repository was created as part of a DevOps training assignment where I built an e-commerce website with a continuous deployment pipeline. Jenkins, an open-source automation server, was used to ensure smooth and automated build, test, and deployment workflows.

## Features
- **E-commerce Website**: A basic e-commerce application with features like product listing and user authentication.
- **Seamless CI/CD Integration**: Automate your build, test, and deployment workflows effortlessly.
- **Rich Plugin Ecosystem**: Extend Jenkins with plugins for notifications, test reporting, integrations, and more.
- **Scalable and Robust**: Run distributed builds across multiple nodes with ease.
- **Code as Configuration**: Define your pipelines in a `Jenkinsfile` for transparency and version control.

## Requirements

To get started, make sure you have the following:

- **Jenkins Server**: Install Jenkins on your server or locally.
- **Java**: Ensure Java is installed (Java 11 is recommended).
- **Git**: For managing your source code.
- **Build Tools**: Depending on your project, tools like Maven, Gradle, or npm might be needed.
- **Web Server**: A server like Apache or Nginx for hosting the e-commerce website.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Jenkins
1. Download Jenkins from the [official website](https://www.jenkins.io/).
2. Follow the step-by-step installation guide for your operating system.
3. Once installed, start Jenkins and access the dashboard at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Step 2: Configure Jenkins
1. Install the recommended plugins during the initial setup.
2. Create user accounts and set up permissions to keep your instance secure.
3. Configure necessary tools (e.g., Java, Git, Maven) via **Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration**.

### Step 3: Create Your CI/CD Pipeline
You can create Jenkins pipelines either through the web interface or by adding a `Jenkinsfile` to your repository. Pipelines as code bring consistency and ease of maintenance.

#### Example Jenkinsfile for the E-commerce Project
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                checkout scm
            }
        }
        
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm install'
                sh 'npm run build'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm test'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'scp -r build/ user@server:/var/www/html'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Trigger a Build
1. Trigger a build manually by clicking **Build Now** in the Jenkins dashboard.
2. Set up webhooks in your Git repository for automated builds on every commit.

## Best Practices
- **Version Your Jenkinsfile**: Keep your pipeline definition in version control for transparency and collaboration.
- **Adopt Declarative Pipelines**: These are simpler to read, write, and maintain.
- **Regular Backups**: Secure your Jenkins configurations with regular backups.
- **Leverage Build Agents**: Distribute workloads across nodes to improve performance.
- **Monitor Pipelines**: Regularly review logs and console outputs for smooth operations.

## Troubleshooting
Encountering issues? Donâ€™t worryâ€”here are some common solutions:
- **Jenkins Wonâ€™t Start**: Check the logs at `$JENKINS_HOME/logs` for error details.
- **Permission Problems**: Verify user roles and permissions in **Manage Jenkins > Manage Users**.
- **Pipeline Errors**: Use the detailed console output from the failed stage to debug.
